                 Grogu was a male Force-sensitive Mandalorian belonging to the same mysterious species as the legendary Grand Master Yoda. Grogu was born in the year 41 BBY, and was raised at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant as a Jedi Initiate of the Jedi Order. Grogu survived the Great Jedi Purge and was hidden away. Grogu was rediscovered by a remnant of the Galactic Empire after it fell, and became known to many simply as "The Child," during the New Republic Era. However Grogu was rescued by Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter where he became a foundling. Djarin was able to find a Jedi to train him and he rejoined the Jedi Order under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. However, Skywalker sensed that Grogu's heart was not in learning the Jedi path, thus he subsequently gave in to his attachment to the Mandalorian.
